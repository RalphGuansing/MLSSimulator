# MLSSimulator in C

## This is a personal project of mine done for better understanding of storing data.
This project does a very basic simulator for an application with Register and Login.
This basic project is to be done on the C Programming Language.
Once logged in, Students must be able to:
  * View available classes
  * Enroll Classes
  * Drop Classes 
  * View current subjects
  * View personal profile

Also admin accounts must be able to:
  * View all Classes
  * Add classes 
  * Remove classes
  * View class list

The program must also be able to save any additional information added or removed.
